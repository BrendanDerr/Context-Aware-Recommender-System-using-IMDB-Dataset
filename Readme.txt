Attached is the entire java project file IMDB
The file for execution is the CARS.java file. 
This program takes a file as input. The file is a list of movies that the user has watched and liked.
The program begins by loading the IMDb movies.txt file and begins processing the data. 
Once that is processed, the program asks the user for the file name to use as user input.
Inside the java project, the file Testing is a list of movies pulled at random from the IMDb movies.txt file and this can be used to run the program
You can use a different file but it must be moved inside the java project IMDB prior to use. 
Once the user enters the file name, more processing is done using that file then the interface presents a number of options to the user.
You can do any of those options and then close the program using the command explained in the interface.

The program was run and compiled in Eclipse if that helps.
